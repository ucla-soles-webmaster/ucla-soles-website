                                The Society of Latinx Engineers and Scientists at UCLA (SOLES) is a student 
                                organization in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science,
                                and is a student chapter of SHPE. We center around empowering Latinx students 
                                in engineering and science both at the UCLA and at nearby K-12 schools. Learn more <Link to={ROUTES.ABOUT}>here.</Link>

                                SOLES|SHPE at UCLA prides itself in being an organization that seeks to elevate its members to excel in all aspects of their lives. 
                                We celebrate the unique qualities and experiences Latinx individuals contribute in engineering, empowering our members to have confidence 
                                in their abilities, regardless of individual circumstances. We hold four chapter pillars of academic development, professional development, 
                                community outreach, and recruitment/retention, which we align with our goals and mission in all of our endeavors.  Please use this site as a
                                resource to explore how we reach our goals and how our members benefit from our interdisciplinary academic resources, community building events,
                                community outreach initiatives, and wide-spread industry partnerships! With these tools and the connections they bring, we hope to pave the way for 
                                a future in which all Latinx/Hispanic students are empowered, both at UCLA and in the greater Los Angeles community, to pursue a STEM degree and 
                                achieve high standards.

                                Returning to an in person world after these difficult times, SOLESâ€™s main goal is to rekindle the sense of Familia throughout our membership, 
                                providing them with all the support and resources we can possibly give. My hard working board and I, all see the potential for SOLES to grow 
                                with new ideas and opportunities. SOLES has been my home away from home, where I have been able to explore more of my own potential and passions, 
                                inspire myself to prosper as a Latina in STEM, and lean on those who understand me. I wish to provide this feeling and more, to each individual, 
                                so they may one day look back and appreciate what SOLES meant for them. Diversity and Inclusion are values I have held since I was a little girl. 
                                I believe everyone should have the opportunity to explore their interests and grow as an individual no matter their backgrounds. I plan to be the 
                                President who firmly stands for SOLES and all of its members, meanwhile also providing all the love and support she can give for her growing family.
